        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Sick students at <strong>UMass struggle to access meals</strong> due to the limitations of the <strong>Get Well Soon</strong> program. Currently, students must rely on <span class="highlight">friends or RAs</span> to pick up meals, which <span class="highlight">isn’t always possible</span>. Additionally, the meals are <span class="highlight">predefined, non-customizable, and unsuitable</span> for those with dietary restrictions or allergies.</p>

        <h3>Why This Problem Needs Solving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Support:</strong> Sick students, especially those without nearby family or friends, can feel helpless.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited & Inflexible Meal Options:</strong> Pre-set meals don’t allow personalization, which is a problem for students with <span class="highlight">dietary restrictions or allergies</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Burden:</strong> If campus meal options don’t work, students may have to <span class="highlight">order from DoorDash</span>, which can be expensive.</li>
            <li><strong>Appointment & Medicine Management:</strong> Booking UHS appointments is inconvenient, and managing medications can be <span class="highlight">disorganized or lack privacy</span>. A centralized system can ensure <span class="highlight">discreet notifications</span> and <span class="highlight">secure appointment tracking</span>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We aim to design a <strong>more convenient and accessible food ordering and delivery system</strong> that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows students to <strong>order meals that fit their needs</strong></li>
            <li>Provides a <strong>delivery option for isolated students</strong></li>
            <li>Offers <strong>a centralized platform</strong> for meal orders, medical appointments, and medicine tracking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This ensures that <strong>sick students can focus on recovery instead of struggling with logistics</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Evaluation (Heuristic)</h2>
        <!--add image-->
        <h3>Average Ratings:</h3>
        <div class="ratings">
            <p><strong>Evaluation 1:</strong> 1.1/4</p>
            <p><strong>Evaluation 2:</strong> 1.4/4</p>
            <p><strong>Evaluation 3:</strong> 1.1/4</p>
            <p><strong>Evaluation 4:</strong> 1.3/4</p>
            <p><strong>Evaluation 5:</strong> 1/4</p>
        </div>

        <p>Based on the average ratings, the app is overall <strong>functional</strong> but has several areas requiring improvement.</p>

        <h3>Strengths:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Design:</strong> The evaluators agree that the app’s design aligns well with real-world usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Task Recognition and Recovery:</strong> No issues with recognizing task steps, and the app effectively supports error recovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Minor Issues:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Some cosmetic issues with colors and light/dark mode inconsistencies, though they do not significantly affect usability.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility and Efficiency:</strong> Usability could improve with more flexible features, such as adding notes for food orders or delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="highlight">Major Concerns: Error Prevention</h3>
        <p>The app <strong>violates the error prevention heuristic</strong> in several ways, causing significant usability challenges. Key issues include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of safeguards against inputting incorrect addresses.</li>
            <li>Absence of an option to sign up using an email address.</li>
            <li>Missing reminders for medication timing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prioritize</strong> addressing error prevention issues to improve usability and user satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Enhance <strong>flexibility features</strong> and refine aesthetic elements for a more polished user experience.</li>
        </ul>
