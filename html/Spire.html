    <section class="about-text">

      <h3 class="section-heading">Problem</h3>
      <div class="about-bio">
        <p>UMass SPIRE serves as a central hub for thousands of students and staff to access their college profiles and manage essential academic tasks. However, navigating SPIRE often presents significant challenges due to its cluttered interface, poorly defined labels, and frequent bugs. These issues not only frustrate users but also hinder their ability to efficiently access and explore the platform's features.</p>
        <p>By implementing a more intuitive navigation structure with clear, well-defined labels, SPIRE could greatly enhance the user experience, fostering easier exploration and improved access to critical information.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Key Interview QA's</h3>
      <div class="about-bio">
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> "What are the biggest frustrations students face when using UMass SPIRE?"<br>
           <strong>A:</strong> "The interface is confusing and the labels aren't clear. For example, it's confusing to differentiate between "Academic" and "Manage Classes"— I'm not sure what each section contains."</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> "How do the current issues with SPIRE impact your experience?"<br>
           <strong>A:</strong> "It makes tasks take longer than they should, and I avoid exploring features because it's too frustrating."</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Design Changes and Rationale</h3>
      <div class="about-bio">
        <p>I introduced an “Upcoming” feature to help students stay on top of their academic commitments by preventing overlooked deadlines and conflicting exam schedules.</p>
        <p>To enhance clarity and accessibility, I renamed “Academics” and “Manage Classes” to “Academic Overview” and “Class Planner.” I also enlarged icons for better visibility.</p>
        <p>The "Finances" section previously displayed visible balances which could cause discomfort. I replaced it with a more private note while still providing essential info.</p>
        <p>A new “Health” section was introduced to support both physical and mental wellness, and integrated financial aid into “Finances” for better intuitiveness.</p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="section-heading">Dropdown + Search Redesign</h3>
      <div class="about-bio">
        <p>I relocated the “Student/Employee” switch to a dropdown menu. Previously, users had to find a separate link, which was unintuitive.</p>
        <p>A logout button was added directly in the panel for easier access.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I removed the unclear “heart/favorite” icon and added a universal search bar that allows students to find content across sections—not just the menu.</p>
